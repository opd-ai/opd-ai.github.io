## The Dreamweaver üí´
*Episode 11 of Echoes of the Unnamed*
For 3-6 investigators of levels 6-8

> "In perfect sleep lies the death of dream's mystery." - The Nightmare Sage

### Introduction
Within the Dream Spire, Madame Morpheus has transformed dreams into pure mathematical certainty. Visions flow in precise sequences, nightmares follow calculated patterns, and sleep itself bends to predetermined equations. Yet among countless perfect dreams, one nightmare spirals freely - a reminder that true dreaming cannot be bound by formulas alone.

### Act 1: The Dream Spire üåô

#### The Perfect Sleep
Dreams move in geometric precision, visions align in synchronized beauty.

**Scene: Evening Calculations**
> Morpheus surveys the dreamscape: "Every vision, a perfect equation."
> A dreamer weeps: "But Madame, the dreams... they no longer dance!"
> Morpheus adjusts their sleep engine: "Dance is chaos. Dreams are mathematics."

**Spire Features:**
- Living dream matrices plotting calculated visions
- Nightmare engines computing perfect terrors
- Sleep matrices flowing in measured paths
- Dream controls humming with certainty

#### Pattern Recognition
Players might notice:
- Dreams moving in synchronized formations
- Nightmares shifting in counted sequences
- Visions flowing in calculated channels
- One nightmare writhing freely above

### Act 2: The Slumber Chamber üå†

#### Morpheus's Domain
Where sleep forces bow to mathematical will.

**Scene: Perfect Dreaming**
> "Each vision, each nightmare, each slumber - all part of the grand pattern."
> The Nightmare Sage whispers: "Dreams' heart beats in chaos."

**Chamber Features:**
- Dream calculators spinning equations
- Vision chambers pulsing with precision
- Sleep matrices glowing with power
- Perfect nightmare engines turning slowly

### Act 3: The Wild Nightmare üëÅÔ∏è

#### Sleep's Last Freedom
Deep within, where one nightmare defies the pattern.

   - Create precise terrors
   - Remove visionary freedom

### Act 4: The Final Dream üåë
