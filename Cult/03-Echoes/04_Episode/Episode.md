## The General ‚öîÔ∏è
*Episode 4 of Echoes of the Unnamed*
For 3-6 investigators of levels 6-8

> "In the perfect formation, we march to our own extinction." - Sergeant Chaos

### Introduction
The Iron Prefecture's armies move like clockwork beneath Commander Steel's calculating gaze. Every battle becomes an exercise in mathematical certainty, each soldier a component in a grand geometric equation. Yet across Steel's face, a single diagonal scar defies their perfect patterns - a reminder that true combat cannot be reduced to numbers alone.

### Act 1: The Strategic Citadel üè∞

#### The Perfect War Room
The command center pulses with living battle maps and whirring tactical engines, every surface covered in endless calculations.

**Scene: Battle Planning**
> Commander Steel traces perfect geometric formations: "War is mathematics. Nothing more."
> A junior officer reports: "Sir, the guerrilla forces... they're not following any pattern."
> Steel's scar throbs visibly: "Then we shall teach them perfection."

**Command Features:**
- Tactical engines project troop movements in crystalline precision
- Battle maps recalculate victory probabilities in real-time
- Officers move like chess pieces across strategic floors
- Every wall displays interlocking combat equations

#### Pattern Recognition
Players might observe:
- Troops moving in perfect geometric formations
- Officers speaking in mathematical terms
- Strategic displays showing only perfect outcomes
- Steel's scar pulsing when plans go awry

### Act 2: The Training Grounds ‚öîÔ∏è

#### Formation Fields
Where soldiers learn to surrender individual combat instincts to the greater pattern.

**Scene: Perfect Drill**
> "Left! Right! Calculate! Strike!" 
> Sergeant Chaos watches from shadows: "They're not soldiers anymore. They're variables."

**Training Features:**
- Geometric drill patterns etched into grounds
- Soldiers moving with mechanical precision
- Combat calculators measuring perfect strikes
- Pattern-enforcement fields

### Act 3: The Old War Room üóùÔ∏è

#### Sergeant Chaos's Haven
Hidden beneath the citadel, where true tactical thinking survives.

**Military Horrors:**
1. **Formation Entities** (HP: 90, AC: 17)
   - Manifest as perfect geometric shapes
   - Attack in synchronized patterns
   - Enforce tactical conformity
   - Drain combat initiative

2. **Strategy Spectres** (HP: 70, AC: 16)
   - Calculate perfect counterattacks
   - Move with mathematical precision
   - Eliminate tactical uncertainty
   - Convert chaos to order

### Act 4: The Final Battle ‚ö°

#### The Convergence
Steel attempts to perfect warfare itself, triggering a clash between pattern and chaos.

**Boss Fight: Commander Steel** (HP: 150, AC: 19)
- **Phase 1:** Formation Master
  - Controls troop movements
  - Creates geometric battlefields
  - Forces pattern compliance

- **Phase 2:** Perfect Strategist
  - Calculates all possible outcomes
  - Manipulates battlefield geometry
  - Enforces tactical certainty

- **Phase 3:** The Scar's Truth
  - Chaos breaks through patterns
  - True combat emerges
  - Perfect formations shatter

### Resolution Paths

#### Breaking the Pattern
Players can:
- Introduce random tactics
- Trigger Steel's scar memories
- Disrupt formation geometries
- Embrace combat chaos

#### Saving True Combat
Success requires:
- Preserving tactical initiative

- Trade patterns form
- Economic certainty looms
- Perfect commerce threatens

### DM Guidance

#### Creating Atmosphere
- Describe mechanically perfect movements
- Contrast instinctive and calculated combat
- Emphasize the horror of controlled warfare
- Build tension between order and chaos

#### Key NPCs
