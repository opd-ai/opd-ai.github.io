![The throne room of Aldemar during a diplomatic reception, featuring nobles in elaborate Victorian-era formal wear. The room's architecture shows impossible angles in the shadows, while a mysterious dark figure in military regalia stands ominously in the background. Reality seems to bend slightly around the edges of the scene. Style: Victorian gothic meets cosmic horror, with strong architectural elements and formal military influences. Cinematic lighting with emphasis on shadows and subtle reality distortion.](illustration_caption_2.jpeg)
