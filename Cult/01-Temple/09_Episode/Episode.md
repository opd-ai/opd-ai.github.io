## Halls of Broken Time ‚åõ
### A Temporal Nightmare for 4-6 Adventurers of Levels 4-6

*"Where yesterday meets tomorrow, and both scream..."*

### Part I: The Temporal Threshold üï∞Ô∏è

#### Initial Entry
Emerging from crystalline geometries, adventurers enter spaces where time itself fragments. Multiple versions of reality coexist, and probability takes physical form. The walls ripple with temporal echoes as past and future collide.

The Moment speaks across all times: *"When are you? When aren't you? Both are true..."*

#### Temporal Zones
*Where time breeds reality*
- Duration: Infinite yet instantaneous
