## Camp of the Damned üå≤
### A Victorian Horror Expedition for 4-6 Adventurers of Levels 3-5

"The jungle holds its breath, and in that silence, madness blooms."

### Background
In the year 1889, the Royal Geographic Society's ambitious Temple Expedition has gone eerily silent. Your party arrives at their research camp following an urgent telegram from Dr. Harrison Wells, the expedition's lead scientist. The previous group, led by the renowned Professor Blackwood, vanished while searching for an ancient temple. Now, as evening approaches, the camp itself seems to pulse with an otherworldly malevolence.

### Adventure Hook
The players receive a telegram from Dr. Wells: "Previous expedition lost. Blackwood missing. Strange phenomena. Come immediately. Generous compensation offered. Bring weapons." The message's paper bears strange, iridescent fungal spots.
