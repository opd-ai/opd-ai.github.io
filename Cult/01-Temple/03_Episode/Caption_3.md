![A vast cathedral-like chamber with walls, floor, and ceiling covered in slowly moving stone faces. Victorian-era explorers in foreground, some showing signs of stone transformation. Mercury-like tears flowing down walls, green-black light pulsing from depths. Photorealistic, cosmic horror, architectural impossibility. Style of Zdzisław Beksiński meets Gothic architecture.](illustration_caption_3.jpeg)
