## The University's Secret
*A One-Shot Adventure for 4-6 Players, Level 8*

### OVERVIEW
50 years after the Catastrophe, Blackbriar University's Department of Theoretical Physics has made breakthrough discoveries in reality manipulation. As students disappear and professors act increasingly erratic, investigators uncover an academic cult breeding ground where forbidden knowledge is taught in secret lectures.
