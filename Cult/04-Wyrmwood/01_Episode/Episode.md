## The Invitation 🏰
*Episode 1 of Shadows on Wyrmwood Isle*
For 3-6 investigators of level 3

> "We simply must document the haunting properly. For historical purposes, you understand..."
> - Moira Blackwood

### Introduction
The morning fog parts to reveal Wyrmwood Plantation, its columned facade rising from the marshy isle like a forgotten temple. Spanish moss drapes the ancient oaks, their branches forming twisted arches over the approaching path. Moira Blackwood, the current owner, has invited paranormal investigators to document the property's supernatural elements - officially for tourism purposes, though her smile never quite reaches her eyes.
