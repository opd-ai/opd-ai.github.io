## The Museum Job üèõÔ∏è
*Episode 2 of Shadows of the Unnamed - A Mystery Adventure for 3-6 Investigators (Levels 3-5)*

> "History comes alive at night... sometimes literally." - Norman the Night Guard

### Introduction
Following the mysterious death of merchant Thomas Blackwood, Inspector Hayes has requested the investigators' help at the Museum of Ancient History. Someone's been stealing specific artifacts, and tonight's "Night of Mystery" exhibition presents the perfect target. But what starts as a simple stakeout quickly turns into something far stranger.

### Setting the Scene üåô
The Museum of Ancient History stands as a grand Victorian edifice of marble and brass, its windows glowing with gaslight as evening falls. Tonight's special exhibition, "Mysterious Civilizations," has drawn quite a crowd - including some suspiciously familiar faces in poorly-fitted museum uniforms.

#### The Players
- **Norman the Night Guard**: "Want a sandwich? I always pack extra. Never know when history might make you hungry!"
- **Dr. Sarah Winters**: "The symbolic significance of these artifacts cannot be overstated..."
- **Father Bernard**: "Don't you see? The pattern in the stealing... it's not random!"
- **Inspector Hayes**: "Just... just keep an eye out. And try not to break anything historical."

### Act 1: Evening Rounds üîç

#### Main Hall
The centerpiece of the museum, dominated by a massive dinosaur skeleton. The security desk sits below its looming skull, where Norman maintains his post (and snack station).

**Key Features:**
- Motion sensors with suspicious timing
- Echo-filled chamber perfect for misdirection
- Norman's squeaky chair that somehow always gives away hiding spots
- Interactive "Shadow and Science" display

**Evening Events:**
1. Meet Norman, who shares both sandwiches and surprisingly insightful observations
2. First glimpse of "fellow docents" acting suspicious
3. Father Bernard's enthusiastic theories about artifact connections
4. Strange symbols appear under ultraviolet light

#### Dialogue Snapshot
Norman: "You know what's weird? The motion sensors only go off when nobody's moving."
Father Bernard: "Exactly! Just like the ancient texts predicted! ... Want a sandwich?"

### Act 2: Night Falls üåë

#### Ancient Civilizations Wing
Glass cases line the walls, filled with artifacts from "mysterious" civilizations. Some displays are conspicuously empty, with only void residue remaining.

**Investigation Elements:**
- Mismatched exhibit labels reveal a pattern
- Void energy traces visible under special lighting
- Hidden curator's door leads to secret study
- Interactive displays malfunction in specific sequences

**Key Events:**
1. Dr. Winters' passionate but oblivious tour
2. Discovery of void residue pattern
3. First animated exhibit encounter
4. Father Bernard's revelation about symbols

#### Notable Dialogue
Dr. Winters: "Notice how the artifacts seem to have shifted position since this morning?"
Father Bernard: "They're not shifting - they're aligning! Don't you see the pattern?"

### Act 3: Things Get Animated ü¶ï

#### The Great Chase
The dinosaur skeleton awakens, controlled by void energy, leading to a museum-wide chase.

**Chase Elements:**
