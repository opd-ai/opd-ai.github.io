<h2 id="the-museum-job">The Museum Job 🏛️</h2>
<p><em>Episode 2 of Shadows of the Unnamed - A Mystery Adventure for 3-6
Investigators (Levels 3-5)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“History comes alive at night… sometimes literally.” - Norman the
Night Guard</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Following the mysterious death of merchant Thomas Blackwood,
Inspector Hayes has requested the investigators’ help at the Museum of
Ancient History. Someone’s been stealing specific artifacts, and
tonight’s “Night of Mystery” exhibition presents the perfect target. But
what starts as a simple stakeout quickly turns into something far
stranger.</p>
<h3 id="setting-the-scene">Setting the Scene 🌙</h3>
<p>The Museum of Ancient History stands as a grand Victorian edifice of
marble and brass, its windows glowing with gaslight as evening falls.
Tonight’s special exhibition, “Mysterious Civilizations,” has drawn
quite a crowd - including some suspiciously familiar faces in
poorly-fitted museum uniforms.</p>
<h4 id="the-players">The Players</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Norman the Night Guard</strong>: “Want a sandwich? I always
pack extra. Never know when history might make you hungry!”</li>
<li><strong>Dr. Sarah Winters</strong>: “The symbolic significance of
these artifacts cannot be overstated…”</li>
<li><strong>Father Bernard</strong>: “Don’t you see? The pattern in the
stealing… it’s not random!”</li>
<li><strong>Inspector Hayes</strong>: “Just… just keep an eye out. And
try not to break anything historical.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="act-1-evening-rounds">Act 1: Evening Rounds 🔍</h3>
<h4 id="main-hall">Main Hall</h4>
<p>The centerpiece of the museum, dominated by a massive dinosaur
skeleton. The security desk sits below its looming skull, where Norman
maintains his post (and snack station).</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong> - Motion sensors with suspicious
timing - Echo-filled chamber perfect for misdirection - Norman’s squeaky
chair that somehow always gives away hiding spots - Interactive “Shadow
and Science” display</p>
<p><strong>Evening Events:</strong> 1. Meet Norman, who shares both
sandwiches and surprisingly insightful observations 2. First glimpse of
“fellow docents” acting suspicious 3. Father Bernard’s enthusiastic
theories about artifact connections 4. Strange symbols appear under
ultraviolet light</p>
<h4 id="dialogue-snapshot">Dialogue Snapshot</h4>
<p>Norman: “You know what’s weird? The motion sensors only go off when
nobody’s moving.” Father Bernard: “Exactly! Just like the ancient texts
predicted! … Want a sandwich?”</p>
<h3 id="act-2-night-falls">Act 2: Night Falls 🌑</h3>
<h4 id="ancient-civilizations-wing">Ancient Civilizations Wing</h4>
<p>Glass cases line the walls, filled with artifacts from “mysterious”
civilizations. Some displays are conspicuously empty, with only void
residue remaining.</p>
<p><strong>Investigation Elements:</strong> - Mismatched exhibit labels
reveal a pattern - Void energy traces visible under special lighting -
Hidden curator’s door leads to secret study - Interactive displays
malfunction in specific sequences</p>
<p><strong>Key Events:</strong> 1. Dr. Winters’ passionate but oblivious
tour 2. Discovery of void residue pattern 3. First animated exhibit
encounter 4. Father Bernard’s revelation about symbols</p>
<h4 id="notable-dialogue">Notable Dialogue</h4>
<p>Dr. Winters: “Notice how the artifacts seem to have shifted position
since this morning?” Father Bernard: “They’re not shifting - they’re
aligning! Don’t you see the pattern?”</p>
<h3 id="act-3-things-get-animated">Act 3: Things Get Animated 🦕</h3>
<h4 id="the-great-chase">The Great Chase</h4>
<p>The dinosaur skeleton awakens, controlled by void energy, leading to
a museum-wide chase.</p>
<p><strong>Chase Elements:</strong> - Falling bones create obstacles -
Tail swings require acrobatic saves - Hide-and-seek among animated
exhibits - Norman’s perfectly-timed sandwich breaks</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance Tunnel Network:</strong> - Utility access
provides shortcuts - Storage areas full of props become battlegrounds -
Staff passages reveal cult activities - Workshop contains ritual
evidence</p>
<h4 id="action-sequence">Action Sequence</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Dinosaur animation begins during Father Bernard’s explanation</li>
<li>Cultists reveal themselves, dropping disguises</li>
<li>Three-way chase through exhibition halls</li>
<li>Final confrontation in restoration workshop</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="act-4-revelations">Act 4: Revelations 📚</h3>
<h4 id="the-curators-shadow">The Curator’s Shadow</h4>
<p>The true antagonist emerges, revealing the connection between stolen
artifacts and void energy.</p>
<p><strong>Boss Battle Features:</strong> - Controls multiple exhibits
simultaneously - Creates void-touched duplicates - Uses museum
architecture against players - Requires exhibition props to defeat</p>
