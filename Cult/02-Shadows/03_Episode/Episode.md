## A Priest's Last Prayer ‚õ™
*Episode 3 of Shadows of the Unnamed - A Gothic Mystery for 3-6 Investigators (Levels 3-5)*

> "The time for games is over." - Father Bernard's final note

### Introduction
The evening bells of St. Michael's Chapel remain silent for the first time in decades. Father Bernard, the investigators' trusted advisor since the museum incident, missed their scheduled meeting. Through stained glass windows, ethereal choir music echoes despite the empty pews within. Something is terribly wrong.

### Part I: Phantom Hymns üéµ

#### The Prayer Garden
Moonlight bathes the normally welcoming garden in silver shadows. The chapel doors are locked - unusual for Bernard, who always preached "open doors, open hearts."

**Initial Investigation:**
- Garden path shows signs of struggle
- Hidden key under specific statue (Bernard's first puzzle)
- Ghostly choir music grows louder
- Notes in Bernard's handwriting lead inside

#### The Main Chapel
Dark wood pews stretch into shadow, while the pipe organ plays itself - a haunting hymn that Bernard often hummed while working.

**Security Measures:**
- Automated organ system (Bernard's invention)
- Hymn sequence unlocks secret passages
- Sheet music forms musical riddle
- Confessional hides mechanism

**Dialogue Memory:**
*"Music speaks when words fail, my friends. Remember that when you need me most."* - Bernard's words from last week

### Part II: Research and Revelation üìö

#### The Library Wing
Bernard's research sanctuary lies in chaos - but the disorder holds meaning.

**Investigation Elements:**
- Overturned desks form pattern
- Books arranged in specific order
- Hidden message in scattered papers
- Void residue traces path

**Key Discoveries:**
1. Ritual requirements documentation
2. Cult hierarchy charts
3. Void god manifestation research
4. Museum artifact connections

#### Bernard's Office
Personal touches make the revelation more painful:
- Half-finished tea (still warm)
- Family photos face down
- Hidden safe behind portrait
- Last warning partially written

### Part III: The Turn üíî

#### The Discovery
In the chapel's small side chamber, everything changes:
- Bernard's body, arranged ritually
- Final message clutched tight
- Void symbols drawn in blood
- Cultist mask fragment nearby

**Bernard's Final Warning:**
*"My children, I was right - and that's why I'm already dead. The museum was just the beginning. The void god's hunger grows. Trust no noble house. The masquerade... beware..."*
