## The Merchant's End üè∞
*Episode 1 of Shadows of the Unnamed - A Gothic Mystery for 3-6 Investigators (Levels 3-5)*

> "Some doors, once opened, can never truly be closed." - Inspector Hayes

### Introduction
On a storm-wracked night in the merchant district of Ravencross, Theodore Blackwood - collector of curiosities and wealthy merchant - has been found dead in his study. The circumstances are bizarre: locked room, strange symbols drawn in ash, and his prized collection missing. Inspector Hayes, frustrated by his department's dismissal of the "unusual elements," seeks unofficial help.

### Setting the Scene ‚ö°
The Blackwood Manor looms against the stormy sky, its Victorian architecture a testament to merchant wealth. Gas lamps cast wavering shadows across rain-slicked cobblestones as our investigators arrive. Thunder punctuates the scene as Wadsworth, the butler, opens the massive front door with impeccable timing.

#### The Players
- **Wadsworth**: "The study remains... exactly as we found it, *ahem*."
- **Mrs. Blackwood**: "Oh! The horror! The tragedy! The... line?" 
- **Inspector Hayes**: *frantically scribbling in his notebook* "Nothing adds up... literally, in the ledger's case."

#### Dialogue Snapshot
Hayes: "The window was locked from the inside?"
